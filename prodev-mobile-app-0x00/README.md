# Initialize New Expo App

I used the command npx create-expo@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x00 to create a new react native with expo application. 

## npm start

I used the command npm run start to start the development server for my application. After running this command a development server for my project was initialized with a QR code that I could scan using either the expo go app on an android device or my phone's camera on an IOS device.
Scanning this QR code enebled me to view my application on development mode real time.

## npm run reset-project

After running this command, A prompt appeared that asked me if I should create an example file to hold all the info in the app folder. I chose yes and an app-example folder was created in the root of my project.
Not only that, the app folder still remained but had only two files:_layout.tsx and index.tsx
